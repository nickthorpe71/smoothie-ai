    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nSpecial equipment: a plastic straw and two 16-ounce (or four 8-ounce) Mason jars, optional\nUsing the plastic straw, remove the white bitter interior and stem of each strawberry. You do this by centering the straw on the bottom pointed end of the fruit, pushing up through the inside to the top and popping off the stem in one smooth motion. Staying centered on the fruit with the straw is the key to quickly hulling and removing the bitter core of strawberries. (You can alternatively cut the stems and white bitter flesh out with a knife.)\nIn a blender, combine the strawberries, blueberries, coconut water and strawberry yogurt and cover with the lid. Press the setting for puree and let it run until the texture is nice and smooth, at least 30 seconds.\nPour into two 16-ounce Mason jars (or glasses), or four 8-ounce jars. Garnish with granola and mint leaves."
